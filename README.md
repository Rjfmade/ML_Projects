# ML_Projects
 Different ML projects using Anaconda and Jupyter Lab.

 These projects are part of subject Machine Learnig in Ã…bo Akademi, 
 so probably students would found these pieces of code ilustrative.
 I cannot share the questions of these projects as they are not mine

 (Moreover, if the teacher does not plan to change the exercises)  

 ## Project - Mini1

 Here we check the assumptions of the linear regression model before training a a data set in order to predict if some patients would go to rehab in a hospital

 ## Project - Mini2

 A telco company has problems as some of their clients are leaving the company. By using a tree regression our objective is to know why and if our train model is capable to asses wether a client will go or remain in our company

 ## Project - Mini3

 Comparision of two different categories from the list of data we are given from different countries in diferent years. Clustering and trying to find relevant nodes of those clusters would be our objective. This is not a Machine Learning algorithm, but an interpretation challengue.
